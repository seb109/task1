# 🚢 Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess data using the Titanic dataset. It covers essential steps needed before applying machine learning models.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Titanic Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Data Exploration** – Shape, types, missing values
2. **Missing Value Handling** – Median for Age, Mode for Embarked, Dropped Cabin
3. **Encoding** – One-hot encoding for Sex and Embarked
4. **Feature Scaling** – StandardScaler on Age and Fare
5. **Outlier Detection** – Boxplot visualization, optional removal

---

## 📦 Output

- Cleaned and fully numeric dataset
- No missing values
- Ready for ML model training

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Practical data cleaning techniques
- Feature encoding and normalization
- Importance of preprocessing in ML workflows
